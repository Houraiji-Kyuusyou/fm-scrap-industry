---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.4
  Changes:
    - With Roc's Rusting Iron, smelted scrap is always fresh
    - Set show_details_in_recipe_tooltip to false for byproducts to reduce UI clutter

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.3
  Changes:
    - Updated icons for Steel scrap to make them more distinct from iron scrap (suggested by S6X)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.2
  Changes:
    - Scrap amount is now reduced for very expensive recipes (applies sqrt when amount is greater than 1)
  Bugfixes:
    - Add migrations for technology unlocks

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.1
  Minor Features:
    - Add setting to scale the failrate and also tune the minimum failrate value
    - Extend random variance to include the amounts produced from recipes
  Changes:
    - Added constants to the API, allowing other modders to use these values directly instead of hard-coding their own
    - Some scrap ratios have been modified slightly to use the new constants, but are within a factor of 2
    - Random probability variance can now apply different scalars per byproduct
  Bugfixes:
    - Fix failrate calculation ratio
    - Fix issues with failrate and scrap for derusting recipes

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.0
  Major Features:
    - Add new ScrapIndustry.products[].ignore flag, for denylisting any recipes that have the given item in its results
    - Add new ScrapIndustry.items[].recycle variable. When set, an item->scrap recycling recipe will be auto-generated to replace the self-recycling recipe
    - Add new recipes for reprocessing scrap metals into molten metal
  Minor Features:
    - Add "No mercy" mode which makes gears, cables, and sticks produce scrap
    - Add setting to scale how much scrap is produced by recipes
    - Add slight random variance to the amount of scrap produced
  Compatibility:
    - Vanilla/SA Galore's recipes are now more effectively supported with the new API and algorithm changes
    - Add compatibility for brevven's BZ Titanium with Titanium scrap
  Changes:
    - Increased the scale of scrap byproducts by about a factor of 5
  Bugfixes:
    - Fix Iron scrap not actually rusting, rusts at half the time
    - If a recipe already contains a scrap byproduct in its results, it won't be added and the failrate won't be applied
    - Fix existing probabilities being handled incorrectly by failrate / success_penalty

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.1
  Compatibility:
    - Add support for Roc's Rusting Iron with Rusty iron scrap

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.0
  Major Features:
    - Add Hand-crafting friendly setting (enabled by default) that makes hand-crafting things easier.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.2
  Minor Features:
    - [space-age] Added setting to disable Lithium scrap being volatile
    - Fish now yield Plastic bits! Yeah, it makes me sad too
  Changes:
    - [space-age] Increase lithium dust yield from lithium plates by 50% (0.02 -> 0.03)
    - [space-age] Increase lithium dust yield from lithium by 100% (0.01 -> 0.02)
    - [space-age] Reintroduce using the fire signal icon when >= 2.0.34
    - [space-age] Buffed lithium fire slightly (damage falls off much slower)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.1
  Bugfixes:
    - Hotfix for load error on 2.0.32 due to missing new signal-fire.png icon

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0
  Major Features:
    - [space-age] Add Lithium dust as scrap from lithium and lithium plates. Unstable!
  Changes:
    - [space-age] Slightly nerfed Bioplastic from bits ratio to match Plastic bars from bits (4:3:3 -> 3:2:2)
  Modding:
    - ScrapIndustry.recipes[] can now have ignore=false, bypassing category-based restrictions

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.1
  Minor Features:
    - [space-age] New Bioplastic from bits recipe for using your Plastic bits on Gleba

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
  Major Features:
    - Add new Plastic bits as scrap from plastic bars and LDS
  Minor Features:
    - LDS now yields copper scrap and plastic bits
    - [space-age] Superconductors now yield holmium and copper scrap, and plastic bits if enabled
    - [space-age] Supercapacitors now yield holmium and circuit scrap
    - Engine units now yield iron and steel scrap
    - Electric engine units and Flying robot frames now yield steel and circuit scrap
  Changes:
    - Remove self_scrap from advanced circuit and processing unit recipes
    - Change Low density structure casting to be ignored
  Modding:
    - Add API support for multiple scrap results from a single item

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.1
  Changes:
    - Increase steel scrap yields from recipes by 50% across the board (steel plates: 0.0
    - Increase copper scrap yield from copper plates by 50% (0.02 -> 0.03)
    - Increase copper scrap yield from copper cables by 100% (0.01 -> 0.02)
    - Engine units and Flying robot frames now yield steel scrap
    - Electric engine units now yield circuit scrap
    - Properly set failrate to 0 for Kovarex enrichment process
  Bugfixes:
    - Recycling and rocket building recipes are now ignored
    - Fix priority for nuclear ore byproducts not being set (thanks s6x!)
